- Impact of each issue
- Recommended next steps

**Reading time:** 5 minutes

### 2. **ANALYSIS_QUICK_FIX.md** ← IMPLEMENT FIRST

Concrete 30-minute fix for the most critical issue:

- Commands discovery only finds ~25 commands instead of 43
- Shows exact code changes needed
- Validation checklist

**Time to implement:** 30 minutes

→ Read **COMPARISON_ANALYSIS_ASSESSMENT.md** (15 min detailed)
→ Decide on phases

### I want the full implementation plan

→ Read **ANALYSIS_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md**
→ Choose phases based on priority
→ Copy code snippets and adapt

## What Gets Fixed At Each Phase

### Phase 1: Fix Command Discovery (30 min)

```
BEFORE:  ❌ Analyzes only ~25 commands
AFTER:   ✅ Analyzes all 43 commands
REVEALS: Which optimizations actually worked
```

### Phase 1b: Add Minified Metrics (1 hour)

```
BEFORE:  ❌ Uses source lines (not realistic)
AFTER:   ✅ Shows minified size per command
REVEALS: Which commands are heavy in production
```

### Phase 2: Bundle Composition (2-3 hours)

```
BEFORE:  ❌ "Bundle is 664 KB" (what takes space?)
AFTER:   ✅ Runtime: 50 KB, Parser: 125 KB, Commands: 380 KB, etc.
REVEALS: Where to focus optimization efforts
```

### Phase 3: Optimization Tracking (1 hour)

```
BEFORE:  ❌ "We optimized 5 commands" (did it help?)
AFTER:   ✅ Shows before/after metrics for each optimization
REVEALS: Which approaches actually reduce bundle size
```

## Implementation Decision Tree

```
START
  │
  └─→ Run current analysis?
      Yes → See what's missing, come back
      No → Continue
      │
      └─→ Do you have 30 min?
          Yes → Do QUICK_FIX (commands-v2 support)
          No → Skip to planning
          │
          └─→ After QUICK_FIX works?
              Run analysis again → See accurate baseline
              │
              └─→ Do you have 2-3 hours more?
                  Yes → Do Phase 2 (bundle composition)
                  No → Phase 1 is enough for now
                  │
                  └─→ Need optimization progress tracking?
                      Yes → Add Phase 3 (1 hour)
                      No → Done with enhancements
```

## Key Metrics These Tools Should Track

| Metric                        | Current                            | How Tools Measure            | Value               |

| **Code Ratio**                | 2.97x                              | LokaScript lines vs Original | Optimization impact |
| **Minified Size**             | Unknown                            | Remove whitespace/comments   | Production reality  |
| **Top Offenders**             | repeat, set, default, make, toggle | Line count comparison        | Prioritization      |
| **Optimization Verification** | Untracked                          | Before/after metrics         | Progress visibility |
| **Next Targets**              | Hard to identify                   | Category-based analysis      | Roadmap planning    |

## Context: Recent Optimizations

These optimizations happened but analysis doesn't fully capture them yet:

```
Commit 606a216: Optimize 5 high-bloat commands (repeat, set, default, make, toggle)
Commit 59890e8: Extract DOMModificationBase for add/remove commands
Commit 71abe1c: Extract ControlFlowSignalBase for break/continue/exit
Commit e02bae4: Extract VisibilityCommandBase for show/hide consolidation
Commit bb5bc56: Consolidate command implementations for bundle size reduction
```

**After QUICK_FIX:** Analysis will verify if these actually helped.

---

## Questions to Answer with Enhanced Tools

- ✅ Code ratio actual vs claimed? (2.97x might be stale)
- ✅ Which 5 commands take most space? (minified size)
- ✅ Did base class consolidations work? (before/after metrics)
- ✅ Is parser the bottleneck? (composition analysis)
- ✅ Next 5-10 optimization targets? (category-based grouping)
- ✅ Semantic parser could be optional? (dependency analysis)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md** (5 minutes)
2. **Read ANALYSIS_QUICK_FIX.md** (5 minutes)
3. **Apply the fix** (30 minutes)
4. **Run analysis** (2 minutes)
5. **Review results** (10 minutes)
6. **Decide on Phase 2** based on what you learn

**Total time to Phase 1 working:** ~1 hour including testing
