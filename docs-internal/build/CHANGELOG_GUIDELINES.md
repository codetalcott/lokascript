## Validation

Before publishing, run:

```bash
node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs
```

This script checks that:

1. No private package names appear in the changelog
2. All mentioned packages are public
3. Version sections are properly formatted

## Style Guide

### Format

- Use Keep a Changelog format
- Group changes by category (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
- Use bullet points starting with `-`
- Put package names in **bold** when introducing new packages
- Put package names in code format for specific changes: `@lokascript/core`

### Examples

**Good**:

```markdown
### Added

- **New Command**: Added `fetch` command to @lokascript/core for HTTP requests
- **Language Support**: Added Korean language support to @lokascript/semantic
```

**Bad**:

```markdown
### Added

- Added analytics tracking to @lokascript/analytics (private package - shouldn't be here)
- Updated internal build tools (not user-facing)
```

### Version Entries

Each version should have:

- Version number and date: `## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-25`
- At least one non-empty category
- Clear, concise descriptions
- Links to issues/PRs where relevant

### Breaking Changes

Clearly mark breaking changes:

```markdown
### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `compile()` now returns `CompileResult` instead of throwing errors
  - Migration: Change `try/catch` to check `result.ok`
  - See migration guide: [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)
```

## Workflow

1. When bumping version: `npm run version:bump -- patch`
2. Script creates empty template in CHANGELOG.md
3. **Manually fill in changes** (this is where you filter out private packages)
4. Validate changelog: `node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs`
5. Commit and push
6. Publish packages

## Reference

To see which packages are public vs private:

```bash
# List public packages
node scripts/list-packages.cjs --public

# List private packages
node scripts/list-packages.cjs --private

# Check changelog for private packages
node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs
```
